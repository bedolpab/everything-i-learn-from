# Everything I Learn From
All of the sources listed below are from material that I have learned from. Whether these are readings, videos, audios, or other, they have contributed to my knowledge basis and I believe I have a moral obligation to credit them. The sources below are in no particular order. Date of when I began collecting this material: September 13, 2025. Note, some material I may not have read that day, but it will be added here as something to read in the future.
